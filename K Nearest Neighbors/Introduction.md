# K Nearest Neighbors

K Nearest Neighbors, or KNN, is a simple and effective machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It is a non-parametric and lazy learning algorithm, which means it does not make any assumptions on the underlying data distribution and it does not learn a model. Instead, it stores all the training data and makes predictions based on the similarity between new data points and the stored training data.

In KNN, the value of K is a hyperparameter that you need to specify before training the model. It determines the number of neighbors that the algorithm will consider when making predictions. For example, if K is set to 3, the algorithm will consider the 3 closest neighbors to a new data point and make a prediction based on the class or label of those neighbors.

The similarity between data points is usually measured using a distance metric, such as Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance. Euclidean distance is the most commonly used distance metric and it calculates the straight-line distance between two points in a multi-dimensional space. Manhattan distance, on the other hand, calculates the distance between two points by summing the absolute differences of their coordinates.

Once the distance between the new data point and its neighbors is calculated, the algorithm assigns a class or label to the new data point based on the most common class or label among its neighbors. For example, if the 3 closest neighbors to a new data point belong to class A, the new data point will also be classified as class A.

KNN can be used for both classification and regression tasks. In classification, the algorithm predicts a class or label for a new data point based on the classes or labels of its neighbors. In regression, the algorithm predicts a continuous value for a new data point based on the values of its neighbors.

One of the main advantages of KNN is that it is simple and easy to implement. There are no complex models to build or train, and the algorithm is easy to understand. It is also a good algorithm for small datasets, as it does not require a lot of data to make accurate predictions.

However, KNN has some limitations as well. One of the main limitations is that it requires a large amount of memory to store the training data, which can be a problem for large datasets. It is also a slow algorithm, as it needs to calculate the distance between the new data point and all the training data points every time it makes a prediction.

Another limitation of KNN is that it is sensitive to the scale of the features. For example, if one feature has a much larger scale than the other features, it will dominate the distance calculation and have a larger influence on the prediction. To address this issue, it is recommended to scale the features before training the model.

KNN is a good algorithm to use as a baseline for comparison with other more complex algorithms. It is also a good algorithm to use when the relationships between the features and the target are not well understood, as it does not make any assumptions about the underlying data distribution.

# Conclusion

In summary, K Nearest Neighbors is a simple and effective machine learning algorithm that is used for classification and regression tasks. It is easy to implement and performs well on small datasets, but it has some limitations such as the need for a large amount of memory and the sensitivity to the scale of the features. It is a good algorithm to use as a baseline for comparison with other algorithms and when the relationships between the features and the target are not well understood.
